Cookie Comptroller
==================

Do you click cookies? Do you like the metric system? Do want to know how long
that cookie upgrade will take to pay for itself, or the total cost of 100
antimatter condensers? If so, check with Cookie Comptroller.

Cookie Comptroller is an add-on for the web game `Cookie Clicker`_. Its goal is
to provide information-rich and up-to-date views on your cookie economy.

Greasemonkey_. Install Cookie Comptroller from its

Do you find Cookie Comptroller helpful? Are there other things about your
cookie economy that you're curious about, or other ways to view the data that
could make it more relevant or expressive? Post about it in discussions_.

Cookie Comptroller would not have happened if Cookie Clicker's source had not
been so readily available to read. Writing this add-on has been more fun and
rewarding than playing the game alone. In the same spirit, `Cookie Comptroller's
source is fully available`_, and I hope you have fun with it too.

Cookie Comptroller was developed primarily with `Chrome DevTools`_ and makes use
of AngularJS_.

`Cookie Monster`_ users take note: Cookie Monster might not load after Cookie
Comptroller. If you can figure out how to make Cookie Monster load *before*
Cookie Comptroller, that might work.
